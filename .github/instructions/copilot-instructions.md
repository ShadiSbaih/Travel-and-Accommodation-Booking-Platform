- i work with react typescript
- Do not create readme (md) file after each feature
- always move the types and interfaces to the types files
- my app works on modular frontend architecture feature based , so always create files in the respective feature folder and determine the correct feature folder
-use @ for absolute imports from src folder
-use mui components for ui design
-always try to optimize the code and avoid redundancy
- always use custom hooks for redux state management
- always use custom hooks for api calls
- always divide the components into smaller components for better readability and reusability
-after each edit always suggest a commit message summarizing the changes
